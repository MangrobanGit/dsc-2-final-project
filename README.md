PROJECT GOAL
The goal of this project is to test your ability to gather information from a real-world database and use your knowledge of statistical analysis and hypothesis testing to generate analytical insights that can be meaningful to the company/stakeholder.

USE OF ALTERNATIVE DATABASES
The original idea was to use the Northwind database, an example relational database created by Microsoft. After thinking about the goal of the project, we want to open up alternative datasets that can be used in lieu of the Northwind database to give students the opportunity to interact with real-world data.

SQL REQUIREMENTS
You are required to import your static files (i.e. .csv, .json, .txt) files into a PostgreSQL database. By working with a relational database, you’ll get practice at crafting queries that pull out relevant data prior to performing statistical analysis.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS
The goal of your project is to query the database to get the data needed to perform a statistical analysis. In this statistical analysis, you'll need to perform a hypothesis test to answer at least one of the questions from the database you choose. 

For each hypothesis, be sure to specify both the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis for your question. You should also specify if this is one-tail or a two-tail test.

In addition to answering this question with a hypothesis test, you will also need to come up with at least 3 other hypotheses to test on your own. These can by anything that you think could be important information for the company/stakeholder.

REVISED STAKEHOLDERS
The use of alternative datasets brings with it a question of who your audience is for this data science project. Much like the Module 1 project, picking an audience at the beginning of your project helps you define the scope of the project. Once a stakeholder is picked, keep them in mind as you’re generating your statistical analysis. When translating statistics for a non-technical audience, be sure you are answering questions that are relevant to the stakeholder and being clear with the limitations of your findings.

## Executive Summary
We were tasked with gathering data from a dataset 'in-the-wild', and performing meaningful hypothesis tests on this data for potential stakeholders. We envisioned our team as soccer/futbol consultants who are offering our analytical expertise to potential clients (e.g. soccer clubs) to provide them with actionable insights. We performed four hypothesis test to show the range from unmeaningful to working insights.

## Project Description
The project parameters constrainted our choice of datasets to one of four possibilities. Of the four we chose to analyze the a dataset on European soccer, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer).
